            <h2>Live music in Chicago</h2>
            <p>Music is an important part of Chicago’s history and culture. Specific styles of blues, Chicago style jazz, and house music were all developed in Chicago. According to the Chicago Journal,  live music, including clubs, venues, and festivals have been bringing people together in Chicago since the late 1800s.
